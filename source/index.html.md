# Introduction

Welcome to the Reposit Partner API! You can use our API to authenticate with your supplier token and create new Reposits.

<aside class="notice">
For testing please use the <code>https://demo.reposit.co.uk/api/</code> endpoint in the examples below.
</aside>

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: reallySecureApiKey"
```

> Make sure to replace `reallySecureApiKey` with your API key.

Reposit requires you to have an API key to allow access to the API. Getting an API key is simple:

1. [Register](https://reposit.co.uk/register/) an agency or landlord account ([Click here](https://demo.reposit.co.uk/register/) if you'd like to make a demo account for testing).
2. Naviagte to your 'Account' section. Your API key will be displayed on this page.

Reposit expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: reallySecureApiKey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>reallySecureApiKey</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
