# Introduction

Welcome to the Reposit Partner API! You can use our API to create new Reposits from your system.

<aside class="notice">
For testing please use <code>https://demo.reposit.co.uk/deposits/</code> as the base url in the examples below.
</aside>

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer reallySecureApiKey"
```

> Make sure to replace `reallySecureApiKey` with your API key.

<aside class="warning">API keys are designed to map to a single lettings agency. If you are integrating a system that has a concept of organisations/agencies then each one would need to use it's own api key; they would need to create an account with us first and enter their api key into your system.</aside>
Reposit requires you to have an API key to allow access to the API. Getting an API key is simple:

1. [Register](https://reposit.co.uk/register/) an agency or landlord account ([Click here](https://demo.reposit.co.uk/register/) if you'd like to make a demo account for testing).
2. Navigate to your 'Account' section. Your API key will be displayed on this page.

Reposit expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer reallySecureApiKey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>reallySecureApiKey</code> with your supplier API key.
</aside>

# CRM Integrations

> To authorize as a referrer, use this code:

```shell
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer reallySecureApiKey"
  -H "Reposit-Referrer-Token: GreatCRM-bg3khR9oNz"
```

If you are a third party system that is acting as referrer between a landlord / letting agent and Reposit (e.g. CRM systems) then you should include an additional header in `ALL requests`.

`Reposit-Referrer-Token: GreatCRM-bg3khR9oNz`

<aside class="warning">
This code will be used to track activity between your system and ours; so please remember to do this. If you are a referrer system that has not been given a token, <a href="mailto:brendan@reposit.co.uk">send us an email</a>.
</aside>
